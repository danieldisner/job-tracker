# Job Tracker

## About the Project
Job Tracker is an application developed in Vue.js 3 to assist in project and task management. With it, you can organize and track the progress of multiple projects, assign tasks to team members, set deadlines, and much more.

## Technologies Used
- Vue.js 3
- [Other technologies you are using in the project]

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements installed on your machine:
- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository to your computer:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-tracker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd job-tracker
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project
After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server for the project. Run the following command:
   ```
   npm run serve
   ```

This will start the development server, and you can access the project in your browser at http://localhost:8080.

## Running the Fake JSON Server
To run the Fake JSON Server for simulating a backend, follow these steps:

1. Install JSON Server globally if you haven't already:
   ```
   npm install -g json-server
   ```

2. Start the JSON Server by watching your JSON file (e.g., `db.json`). Run the following command in your project directory:
   ```
   json-server --watch db.json
   ```

This will start the JSON Server, which will serve data from your `db.json` file at http://localhost:3000.

## Compiling for Production
If you want to compile the project for production, run the following command:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

This command will generate production-ready files in the `dist` folder, ready to be deployed to a web server.

## Linting and Fixes
To check and fix files with linting issues, use the following command:
   ```
   npm run lint
   ```

This will run linting on all project files and attempt to automatically fix any issues found.
